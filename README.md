This repository contains the code for my personal website, built and hosted with GitHub Pages. The site highlights my latest experiences, technical skills, soft skills, and projects I’ve worked on — serving as a central hub for everything I’m building and learning.

The goal of this website is not just to showcase my work, but also to reflect my journey as a developer, researcher, and learner. 

Check it out to explore my projects, background, and the skills I’m most passionate about!
